This dataset is available on the MavenAnalytics website. In addition, a dataset obtained from PostalCodeZip is used to obtain the approximate latitude and longitude of each country and use them in geospatial visualizations.

Summary: All space missions from 1957 to August 2022, including details on the location, date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, and status of the rocket used for the mission.

The recommended analysis for this dataset is:
- How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?
- Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
- Which rocket has been used for the most space missions? Is it still active?
- Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?
   I could check which countries have a better ratio of successful missions
   I can also visualize the approximate areas with the highest number of launches
