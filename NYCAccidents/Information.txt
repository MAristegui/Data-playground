This dataset is available on the MavenAnalytics website. 

Summary: Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January-August 2020. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

The recommended analysis for this dataset is:
- Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?
- Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?
- On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?
- What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle 1)? What about for fatal accidents specifically?

Extra analysis:
- Geographic visualization using heat maps of accidents by districts
